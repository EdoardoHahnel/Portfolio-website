## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**

### Free Tier Limitations:
- ‚úÖ **Free forever** - no credit card needed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Sleeps after 15 min** of inactivity (first visit takes 30 seconds to wake up)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **750 hours/month** limit (plenty for testing!)
- ‚úÖ **Automatic HTTPS** (secure)

### To Keep It Always Active:

## üîÑ **How to Update Your Website**

Whenever you make changes to your code:

1. **Save changes** in your editor

2. **Open terminal** and run:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Updated website"
   git push
   ```

3. **Render automatically updates** your live website! (takes 2-3 minutes)

## üéØ **Alternative Options**

### **Option 2: PythonAnywhere** (Good for Python)
- Free tier: https://www.pythonanywhere.com
- More steps to set up but very reliable
- 512MB limit on free tier

### **Option 3: Railway** (Modern & Fast)
- Very easy: https://railway.app
- $5/month credit free
- After that, pay-as-you-go

### **Option 4: Buy Your Own Domain**
Once your site is live on Render, you can:
1. Buy a domain (e.g., `portf√∂ljbolagen.se`) from Namecheap/GoDaddy
2. Point it to your Render URL
3. Now your site is: `www.portf√∂ljbolagen.se` üéâ

Cost: ~$10-15/year for `.se` domain

## üÜò **Troubleshooting**

### "Application Error" on Render
- Check the logs in Render dashboard
- Make sure all database JSON files are uploaded
- Check environment variables are set

### Website is slow to load first time
- Normal for free tier! It "wakes up" after sleeping
- Subsequent visits are fast

### Need help?
- Check Render docs: https://render.com/docs
- Or let me know what error you're seeing!
