## 💰 **Cost**

- **GitHub**: FREE ✅
- **Render Free Tier**: FREE ✅
- **Custom Domain** (optional): ~$10-15/year

**Total to get started: $0** 🎉

---

## ⚠️ **One Important Thing**

**Free tier limitations:**
- Website "sleeps" after 15 minutes of no visitors
- First visit takes ~30 seconds to "wake up"
- After that, it's fast!

**To fix**: Upgrade to $7/month plan (optional, only if you need 24/7 speed)
