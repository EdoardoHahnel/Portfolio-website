Founded in 2012 in Brazil, the company rebranded from Gympass to Wellhub in 2023 to reflect its evolution from gym-focused to comprehensive wellbeing. Wellhub partners with over 15,000 companies globally to offer their 3+ million employees flexible access to 50,000+ fitness and wellness partners across 50+ countries. The platform's innovative business model charges companies a monthly fee per employee (similar to health insurance) while employees get discounted or free access to partnered facilities and services. This B2B2C approach creates value for all stakeholders: companies improve employee health and retention, employees get affordable wellness access, and fitness partners fill unused capacity. Wellhub has achieved strong unit economics by aggregating demand and negotiating favorable rates with suppliers while providing them with incremental revenue and reduced customer acquisition costs. The company grew rapidly during COVID-19 by expanding digital offerings including on-demand fitness classes, meditation apps, therapy sessions, and nutrition coaching. With the increasing focus on employee wellbeing and mental health, Wellhub is positioned at the intersection of HR tech, healthtech, and the $96 billion corporate wellness market.",

      "detailed_description": "Wayflyer is a fast-growing fintech company providing revenue-based financing and growth solutions for e-commerce businesses globally. Founded in 2019 in Dublin, Wayflyer has revolutionized how online merchants access capital by offering flexible funding based on actual revenue performance rather than traditional credit metrics. The company uses data from e-commerce platforms (Shopify, Amazon, WooCommerce, etc.) to underwrite loans within 24 hours, providing working capital advances of $10K-$20M to fund inventory, marketing, and growth initiatives. Wayflyer's proprietary underwriting algorithms analyze millions of data points including sales trends, customer behavior, marketing performance, and inventory turnover to assess creditworthiness and set personalized terms. Repayments are automatically deducted as a percentage of daily sales, aligning with business cash flows. This approach has made Wayflyer extremely popular with e-commerce merchants who struggle to access traditional bank financing. Since launch, Wayflyer has deployed over $3 billion in funding to 1,000+ e-commerce companies across 10+ countries. The company has expanded beyond financing to offer marketing and growth tools, creating an integrated platform for e-commerce success. Wayflyer achieved unicorn status in 2022 and has maintained strong growth despite challenging fintech market conditions. The company's data-driven approach, fast decisioning, and flexible terms have created a compelling alternative to traditional financing for the $5+ trillion e-commerce market.",

Founded in 1985, Envirotainer has pioneered the development of air cargo containers with active cooling systems (compressor-based) that maintain precise temperatures for time- and temperature-sensitive pharmaceuticals being shipped globally. The company's containers protect billions of dollars worth of critical medications including vaccines, biologics, gene therapies, and other temperature-sensitive drugs that would be destroyed if exposed to temperature excursions. Envirotainer operates a leasing and services model where pharmaceutical companies lease containers for specific shipments, with Envirotainer providing maintenance, quality assurance, tracking, and global logistics support through its network of service centers at major airports worldwide. The company's RKN and RAP container models can maintain 2-8°C or other required temperatures for up to 200+ hours, with real-time monitoring and data logging to ensure compliance with pharmaceutical regulations. Envirotainer serves all major pharmaceutical and biotech companies, playing a mission-critical role in the global distribution of medications. The growth of biologics, vaccines, and gene therapies (which require strict cold chain) has driven strong demand for Envirotainer's solutions. The company operates a global network with presence at 100+ airports and has a fleet of thousands of containers. In 2022, EQT acquired Envirotainer recognizing the company's market leadership and favorable tailwinds from biologics growth.",

Founded in 2021 in Berlin, Payrails addresses a critical challenge for high-growth e-commerce, marketplaces, and digital platforms: managing complex payment operations across multiple providers while optimizing for cost, approval rates, and user experience. The company's payment orchestration platform provides intelligent routing, smart retries, tokenization, reconciliation, and unified reporting across all payment providers. Payrails allows businesses to easily add or switch payment providers without code changes, A/B test different providers, route transactions based on rules (cost, geography, payment method), and failover to backup providers if primary provider is down. This flexibility and control is particularly valuable for global businesses processing millions of transactions. Payrails also provides advanced features like network tokenization, fraud prevention, PCI compliance simplification, and detailed analytics. The platform serves fast-growing e-commerce companies, marketplaces, and SaaS businesses that have outgrown simple payment solutions and need enterprise-grade orchestration. Payrails competes with older orchestration platforms and aims to be the modern, developer-friendly solution. In 2023, EQT Ventures invested in Payrails recognizing the growing need for payment infrastructure in an increasingly complex payment landscape.",

Founded in 2016, InstaVolt operates a network of over 1,500 rapid and ultra-rapid charging points at locations including retail parks, service stations, supermarkets, and public car parks. The company focuses on 50kW-150kW+ rapid chargers that can charge most EVs to 80% in 20-45 minutes, addressing the critical need for convenient public charging infrastructure. InstaVolt's chargers are strategically located along major routes and at high-traffic retail destinations, ensuring EV drivers can charge while shopping or during travel. The company differentiates through reliability, user-friendly contactless payment, transparent pricing, and high uptime rates. InstaVolt does not require membership or apps - drivers simply tap their credit/debit card to start charging. The company partners with site hosts (retailers, property owners) to install and operate charging infrastructure, sharing revenue from charging fees. InstaVolt is benefiting from massive tailwinds including UK government targets to phase out new petrol/diesel car sales by 2030, rapidly increasing EV adoption, and large infrastructure investment needs to support the EV transition. The company is scaling its network aggressively and improving charger technology. In 2022, EQT Infrastructure invested in InstaVolt recognizing the strategic importance of EV charging infrastructure and the significant growth opportunity.",

      "detailed_description": "CluePoints is a leading provider of central statistical monitoring (CSM) and risk-based monitoring (RBM) solutions for clinical trials, helping pharmaceutical and biotech companies improve data quality, reduce risks, and ensure regulatory compliance during drug development. Founded in 2005 in Belgium, CluePoints pioneered the application of advanced statistics and machine learning to detect data quality issues, protocol deviations, and potential fraud in clinical trial data. The company's software platform analyzes data from clinical trials in real-time, using sophisticated algorithms to identify anomalies, outliers, and patterns that may indicate data integrity problems at investigator sites. This allows sponsors to focus monitoring resources on high-risk sites and issues rather than routine source data verification at all sites. CluePoints' approach aligns with regulatory guidance from FDA and EMA encouraging risk-based monitoring to make clinical trials more efficient while maintaining data quality. The platform integrates with electronic data capture (EDC) systems and clinical trial management systems, providing centralized oversight across global multi-site trials. CluePoints serves top pharmaceutical companies, CROs (contract research organizations), and biotech firms running complex clinical trials. The company's solutions are used in thousands of clinical trials including pivotal studies for drug approvals. CluePoints helps customers reduce monitoring costs by 30-50% while improving data quality and reducing timeline risks. In 2024, EQT Life Sciences invested in CluePoints recognizing the company's market leadership and the growing adoption of risk-based monitoring in clinical trials.",

Cement production accounts for approximately 8% of global CO2 emissions, making it a critical industry for climate action. Cemvision provides technology, software, and services that enable cement producers and concrete manufacturers to reduce their carbon footprint while maintaining product quality and performance. The company's solutions may include alternative materials, production process optimization, carbon capture integration, or low-carbon cement formulations. Cemvision works with cement companies, construction materials suppliers, and infrastructure developers to deploy lower-carbon solutions at scale. The company addresses a massive challenge: the world needs cement for buildings and infrastructure, but traditional Portland cement production is extremely carbon-intensive due to the chemical process of heating limestone. Cemvision is part of a wave of climate tech companies tackling hard-to-decarbonize industrial processes. Potential approaches include supplementary cementitious materials, alternative binders, mineralization technologies, or process modifications. The market opportunity is significant as construction companies, governments, and cement producers face increasing pressure to reduce embodied carbon in buildings and infrastructure. In 2022, EQT Ventures invested in Cemvision recognizing the massive climate impact potential of decarbonizing cement and the company's technical approach to this critical industrial challenge.",

      "detailed_description": "Vara is a health technology company developing AI-powered tools for early breast cancer detection and screening to improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. Founded in Berlin, Vara provides artificial intelligence software that analyzes mammography images to detect potential cancerous lesions, assisting radiologists in breast cancer screening programs. The company's deep learning algorithms are trained on millions of mammogram images to identify suspicious patterns that may indicate early-stage breast cancer, sometimes finding cancers that human radiologists might miss. Vara's AI acts as a 'second reader' providing an independent analysis that can flag cases for additional review or provide confidence in normal findings. The technology addresses critical challenges in breast cancer screening: radiologist shortages, reader fatigue, inter-reader variability, and the difficulty of detecting small early-stage cancers. Vara's solution integrates into existing radiology workflows and PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication Systems), providing decision support without disrupting established processes. The company has achieved regulatory approvals including CE marking in Europe and works with screening programs, hospitals, and imaging centers. Breast cancer screening represents a massive global market with hundreds of millions of mammograms performed annually. Early detection dramatically improves survival rates, making AI tools that improve detection accuracy highly valuable. Vara is part of the growing medical AI sector where machine learning is augmenting physician capabilities. In 2022, EQT Ventures invested in Vara recognizing the company's potential to save lives through improved cancer detection and the large commercial opportunity in medical imaging AI.",

The company's model helps employers control costs through negotiated rates with providers while offering valuable benefits that improve employee wellbeing and retention. Fertility benefits are increasingly viewed as essential employee perks alongside traditional health insurance, especially as more people delay parenthood for career reasons. Fertifa operates in the growing employee benefits and fertility services market, competing with providers like Maven Clinic and Carrot Fertility.

      "detailed_description": "Zooplus is Europe's leading online retailer of pet supplies, offering comprehensive selection of pet food, accessories, toys, and care products for dogs, cats, and other pets through e-commerce platforms across 30 European countries. Founded in 1999 during the dot-com era, Zooplus pioneered online pet supplies retail in Europe and has grown to serve over 10 million active customers. The company offers over 8,000 brands and 180,000+ products including premium and specialty pet foods, medications, toys, accessories, and grooming products. Zooplus operates a subscription model for recurring pet food deliveries, creating predictable revenue and high customer lifetime value. The company has built strong logistics infrastructure with fulfillment centers strategically located across Europe enabling fast delivery and efficient operations. Zooplus combines broad selection, competitive pricing, convenience of home delivery, and subscription automation to serve the growing pet care market. European pet ownership has increased significantly with rising pet humanization trends driving premium product demand and higher spending per pet. Zooplus faces competition from Amazon, local pet retail chains, and specialized online competitors but maintains market leadership through scale, selection, and customer loyalty programs. The company operates localized websites and customer service in each market. In 2021, EQT acquired Zooplus for €3.6 billion in a take-private transaction, delisting the company from the Frankfurt Stock Exchange to pursue long-term growth strategies including expansion, operational improvements, and increased focus on private label products.",

Founded in 1993 in Sweden, Byggmax operates approximately 180 stores across Sweden, Norway, and Finland, offering lumber, construction materials, flooring, paint, tools, and home improvement products. The company pioneered a no-frills warehouse format with self-service, outdoor material yards, and limited staff to minimize operating costs and pass savings to customers. Byggmax targets price-conscious consumers undertaking renovation, construction, and home improvement projects. The company's product range focuses on essentials with limited SKU count (5,000-6,000 products) versus traditional hardware stores with 20,000+ SKUs, enabling efficient inventory management and purchasing power. Byggmax generates revenue from in-store sales with increasing e-commerce and click-and-collect capabilities. The company serves a large customer base with stores located in suburban and smaller city locations with good accessibility and parking. Byggmax went public in 2010 and in 2021 was taken private by Altor in a deal valuing the company at SEK 4+ billion. The Nordic building materials market is attractive with high DIY culture, housing stock requiring maintenance, and steady renovation activity. Byggmax competes with Bauhaus, Jula, and local building merchants, differentiated by discount warehouse positioning and simplified assortment.",
